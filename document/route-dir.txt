IP Registration Directory Format Specification
==============================================

According to the common usage of this VPN network, the IP allocation can be
classified into the following rules, with its format normalized, as the
file name of the routing distribution definition file:

1. /30 Tunnel: `10.127.0.x/30` （where x is divisible by 4）
2. Normal Subnet: `10.127.x.y/z` (where z must be greater than 16）
3. Point-to-Point: `PTP,10.127.x.x~10.127.x.x` （IP on both sides is /32）
4. Loopback Address: `10.127.255.x/32`

Definition Format
=================

The content of the file can be divided into the following fields.
To simplify processing, Shell Script variable definition syntax
will be used as the syntax of the definition file. In addition, variables must
be present if it's not optional and defined in the same order as the following:

	TYPE=
	PROTO=		(only for peer-to-peer /30 tunnels and peer-to-peer /32 peers)
	NAME=		(optional for anything other than Contiguous Subnet and Loopback Address)
	ASN=		(only for Contiguous Subnet and Loopback Address)
	UPSTREAM=	(only for peer-to-peer /30 tunnels and peer-to-peer /32 peers)
	DOWNSTREAM=	(only for peer-to-peer /30 tunnels and peer-to-peer /32 peers)
	DESC=

Detailed Information of Each Variable
=====================================

1. TYPE:	IP Usage Type
	Available options are: TUN30, SUBNET, PTP, LO (corresponding to the IP address
	allocation type in the first section respectively)

2. PROTO:	VPN Protocol Used
	Available options are: Tinc, WireGuard, L2TP, GRE, IPsec/L2TP, IPsec/GRE, OpenVPN, SLIRP, PPP

3. NAME:	Name
4. ASN:		ASN
5. UPSTREAM:	Upstream Node Name
6. DOWNSTREAM:	Downstream Node Name
7. DESC:	Description
